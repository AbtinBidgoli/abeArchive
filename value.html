						<P class="mb-5">~FAQ~<br>
							<br>Which platform will you use for my website?<br>
							~ I develop pages from HTML markup, CCS stylesheets for styling & unobtrusive JavaScript for behaviors on Github.~<br>
							<br>What’s the average cost of the project?<br>
							~ The final price is directly related to the project scope, timeline, & deliverables. Project scope can’t be determined without a strategy brief, so the first stage will commence with a dsicovery 
							process which will simply & concisely detail the project’s creative & communicative objectives as understood. I’ll be able to propose a final price, deadline & authorization to proceed.
							For now I can only give you a ball-park range, the clients I partner with typically come to me with more than $1,000 & less than $10,000 in their budget.~<br>
							<br>What costs should I expect other than website development?<br>
							~ Domain & SEO, Google Domains powered by Google reliability, security & performance & SEMrush, an advanced Search Engine Optimization tool.~<br>
							<br>What if I don’t have the money to invest in a website right now?<br>
							~ Money is personal & investment decisions are hard. Doing the same things that aren’t getting you results is more expensive than taking action & fixing your website.
							It’s like having a top-performing sales rep working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Websites promote you 24/7, no employee can do that.~<br>
							<br>What if I’m not sure I’m ready to invest in a website?<br>
							~ Do you have a clear niche? Mission statement? What value do you offer to your clients?<br>
							If you have a clear answer to all the questions, you’re ready.~<br>
							<br>Do you offer payment plans?<br>
							~ Yes payment is split 4 ways:<br>
							20% deposit to book your slot in my calendar<br> 
							24% at the start of the project<br>
							24% 3 weeks after the initial discovery meeting<br>
							32% at the end of the project.~<br>
							<br>How long will take you to revamp our website?<br>
							~ It depends on the project scope. But from previous experience, designing & developing new landing page can take up to 2 weeks, while more complex websites, can take up to 4-6 weeks.~<br>
							<br>Who owns all the content on my website?<br>
							~ You own everything. I will assign all intellectual property rights when I transfer ownership to you.~<br>
							<br>Do you offer ongoing support after the website is done?<br>
							~ Absolutely we can discuss how I can continue to support you after we go live.~<br>
							<br>Where are you based?<br>
							~ I live in LA but you don’t have to worry about time zones. I contact clients from all over the world, from Dubai to San Diego to Toronto.~<br>
